Initial private release. Windows platform bridge.

### Added
- **Windows 11 platform bridge** (`platforms/windows/`)
  - `windows_gui_mcp.py`: FastMCP server exposing 17 tools over SSE on port 8766
    - Screen: `get_screen_size`, `take_screenshot`
    - Window: `list_windows`, `inspect_window`, `focus_window`
    - Mouse: `click`, `move_mouse`

    - Shell: `run_powershell`
  - `setup-windows.ps1`: one-click installer covering Tailscale check, OpenSSH Server, Node.js LTS, Python venv, firewall rules, and Task Scheduler auto-start for both MCP services
  - `requirements.txt` + `pyproject.toml` for installation
  - `claude-settings.json` reference config for Linux-side Claude Code
- **Tailscale-based cross-network connectivity** (works across LANs, no port-forwarding required)
- **desktop-commander** integration on port 8765 (community shell/file/process MCP via supergateway stdio→SSE bridge)
- **Architecture document** (`docs/architecture.md`) — defines the universal three-segment bridge model and the Universal Tool Set contract that all platforms must implement
- **Roadmap** (`docs/roadmap.md`) — version targets for macOS (0.2.0), Android (0.3.0), iOS (0.4.0), cross-device coordination (0.5.0), public OSS release (1.0.0)
- **Setup guide** (`docs/platforms/windows.md`) — 14-section, ~500-line operations manual in Chinese with troubleshooting checklist

### Security
- MCP ports (8765/8766) are restricted to the Tailscale network interface via Windows Firewall rules; not exposed to LAN or internet
- SSH key-based auth required (Administrator account uses `C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys` with locked ACLs)
